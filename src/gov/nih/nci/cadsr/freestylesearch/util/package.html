            This is the package for the Freestyle Search API, distributed in the <b>freestylesearch.jar</b> file.

        <p>
            <b>Introduction</b>

                The search algorythm impoys weights to a variety of scenarios and configuration settings. Weights are summed for each match to produce a score. The results returned are always in descending order by the score. Any type of Administered
                Component supported by Freestyle may be returned unless certain options are set. The following first descibes the weights and search algorythm. Next the available options are described. More details can always be found by referencing the
                various methods provided in the Search class.
            </p>

            The Administered Components that could be returned from a search are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Data Element

                These are weighted in the order presented for results in the same score group. A score group is two or more results with the same score. Outside of a group these may appear in any order or combination within a search, for example, using the
                search term "Lateral" may return depending on other search settings:

                Notice how the results above are all sorted highest score first. Within matching scores (a score group) the order is by AC as weighted by the list above. In this example the results were truncated for simplicity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also note in the previous example the Concept "Lateral" appears near the end of the list. This is a result of the number of hits the term has within the AC. The columns searched include the following were appropriate: Version, Long Name,
                Preferred Name, Preferred Definition, Question, Public ID, Latest Version Indicator, Created By, Modified By, Workflow Status, Context, Alternate Name, Definition Source and Origin. If the column applies to an AC it is included, e.g. a Data
                Element has a "Question" column however no other AC defines it. A term is counted once per column in which it appears. So again in the previous example "Lateral" appears in more columns in the results at the top of the list.
            </p>
            <p>
                When multiple search terms are provided, e.g. "Congestive Heart Failure", the results score higher when these words are found in the order specified. This extra weight is not applied to single term searches as it becomes a mathematical
                constant and does not affect the result.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some terms are have an inherent weight of zero (0) and are consequently ignored during a search. This applies to all single letters, e.g. "A" and "I", and some predicates and verbs, e.g. "The", "of", "be", "an", etc. These words do nothing
                to narrow a meaningful semantic search, for example the phrases "An agent report" and "The agent report" have subtle contextual implications but are more often a result of choice of wording and not semantically important to the user.
            </p>

            <b>Search Options</b>
        </p>
        <div style="margin-left: 0.5in">
        <p>
            Controlling the search result is performed through the options. This search engine is not intended to provide a programmatic specification for specific columns but is designed from a user perspective to work toward answering a question. The
            user does not need to know how the database is designed or the name of specific columns or tables, e.g. search for something named "agent report", not 'long_name' equals 'agent report'. When the caDSR was curated the terms or words in the
            search phrase could appear in any order and in who knows which columns, i.e. "long_name", "preferred_name", "name", etc. The options available to control the results reflect this philosophy.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are three (3) consistencies in all searches that can not be changed via options. The first is all comparisons are case insensitive. Case in the caDSR and in the search term is ignored by the search engine. The second is word order in
                a multi-term phrase is ignored. As mentioned above a higher score is given when a match to the order is found but that is not a requirement to finding a match. If only one term in a phrase is actually found, results are returned regardless
                of the position of the word in the phrase. The third is special characters are ignored. All punctuation characters are removed during a search. There is no concept of a wildcard within the search terms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although there is no wildcard character and no option to set or create one, there is an option to elect exact and partial term searches. This option applies to all terms in the phrase. Assuming a wildcard character of asterisk ( * ), the
                search engine does not provide for the following scenario, search exactly on "agent" and partially on "report", e.g. "agent report*". The match option instructs the search that all terms are to be compared exactly, e.g. "agent report", or
                compared partially, e.g. "*agent*report*". (The previous examples are abbreviated, remember word order is ignored.) See the Search.setMatchFlag() method for more information.
            </p>
            <p>
                A search results limit may be set to prevent performance and resource issues. Again this was designed with a user perspective and most users have a "reasonable" limit related to how much they expect to read. A good example of this can be
                found with Google. If the desired link isn't on the first page of results most people will play with the search term by adding or arranging words. Some people will progress to the second results page. Statistically very few go beyond that.
                This limit is the total number of results in the return, it is not the results per "page". Pagenation must be handled by the caller if desired. See the Search.setLimit() method for more details.

            include commons-logging.jar if it is present in the JBoss/lib folder.</p>
