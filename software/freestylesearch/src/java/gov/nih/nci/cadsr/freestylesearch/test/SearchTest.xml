    <!-- Define the defaults for all profiles. This avoids redundant entries. During processing
            the defaults create a base template, an individual profile then overwrites the template
            values and processing begins. The next profile overwrites a new refreshed template
            before processing. This makes the "default" profile the foundation for all tests. Use
            "default" in the profile list to execute the default settings with no changes.

        HELP reference information
    
        The index database access values.
        Any key *.index, *.data defines the direct access properties to the caDSR.
        
        The engine access value.
        Any key *.freestyle.url defines the server URL for remote access to the engine.
        
        The API access method.
        Any key *.access define how the engine should be used, either "local" to use the
        direct database properties or "remote" to use the freestyle server URL.
        
        The caCORE access value.
        Any key *.core.url defines the server URL to the caCORE API. This is only required
        and used when the returns method is a "2" or "4" (see below) and the test should
        NOT use the URL defined in the caDSR tool options.

        The search result returns.
        Any key *.returns defines the conteint and format of the search results, these are:
            0 = default
            1 = abbreviated (idseq, score, type)
            2 = caCORE API Administered Component Objects
            3 = a Generic AC Result Set
            4 = the combination object of 1 and 2

        The term matching action type.
        Any key *.matchType defines how the terms in the search phrase is compared within
        the caDSR content, these are:
            0 = exact
            1 = partial
            2 = best.

        The maximum possible number of returns.
        Any key *.limit defines the total number of maximum results.
    
        The maximum number of scores.
        Any key *.scores defines the number of high scores returned up to the *.limit threshold,
        e.g. 3 is the top 3 scores which may be 56, 23, 2 and there may be 2 with a score of 56,
        7 with a score of 23 and 4 with a score of 2 provided the *.limit is set to 13 or greater.

        The AC types of the results.
        Any key *.restricts defines the specific AC types to return in the results.  If all are desired
        do not specific a *.restricts in the default or specific profile. Type values are numeric and
        must be one or more of the following separated by commas.
            0 = DE
            1 = DEC
            2 = VD
            3 = OC
            4 = PROP
            5 = CON
            6 = CD
            7 = VM

        The results to non-retired Workflow Status.
        Any key *.restrictResultsByWorkflowNotRetired defines whether to ignore the AC Workflow
        Status or eliminate the Retired values.
            true = limits the results to NOT Retired AC's.
            false = all AC's are included

        The Test Context.
        Any key *.excludeTest causes all AC's owned by the Test context to be included or excluded.
            true = AC's owned by the Test context are excluded from the results.
            false = AC's owned by the Test context are included in the results if successfully matched.

        The Training Context.
        Any key *.excludeTraining causes all AC's owned by the Training context to be included or excluded.
            true = AC's owned by the Training context are excluded from the results.
            false = AC's owned by the Training context are included in the results if successfully matched.

        The search phrase.
        Any key *.phrase defines the content to match for the search. This may consist of one or more
